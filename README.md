Wick The Chick is a dynamic and engaging game that leverages realistic physics to create challenging platforming gameplay. Players navigate through diverse 3D environments filled with obstacles, moving platforms, and interactive elements that respond naturally to physics forces.

The game includes an upgrade system that allows players to enhance their abilities, unlocking new moves or improving existing ones to overcome increasingly difficult levels. This progression system adds depth and replayability to the experience.

Designed with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in mind, the project features a clean and modular codebase. This approach promotes code reusability, scalability, and easier maintenance, making it ideal for both learning and expanding the gameâ€™s features.

Key features include:

Player upgrade system with customizable abilities

Modular and maintainable code structure following OOP principles

Focus on smooth controls and responsive gameplay

Built in Unity, this project serves as a solid foundation for physics-based platformers, combining core gameplay mechanics with good software design practices.
